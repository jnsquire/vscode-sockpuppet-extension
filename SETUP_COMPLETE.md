# âœ… Automated Setup Complete!

## What Was Done

The setup script successfully prepared your project for the two-repository structure.

### Actions Completed

âœ… **Backup Created**
- Location: `..\vscode-sockpuppet-backup-20250930-213045`
- Contains: Complete copy of all files (excluding node_modules, .git, dist)

âœ… **Structure Verified**
- Checked for Python package files
- Confirmed all necessary files present:
  - `python/pyproject.toml`
  - `python/vscode_sockpuppet/__init__.py`
  - `python/README_STANDALONE.md`
  - `python/.gitignore`
  - `python/LICENSE`

âœ… **Instructions Generated**
- File: `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
- Contains: Step-by-step guide for pushing to GitHub

### Current State

Your project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub as two separate repositories:

**Repository 1: Python Package**
- URL: https://github.com/jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-python
- Status: Ready to create and push
- Will contain: Python client library only

**Repository 2: Extension**
- URL: https://github.com/jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-extension
- Status: Ready to push (after Python repo is created)
- Will contain: VS Code extension + Python package as submodule

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repositories

**Option A: Via GitHub Web Interface**

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `vscode-sockpuppet-python`
3. Description: "Python client for controlling VS Code programmatically"
4. Public
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Create repository

Repeat for extension repository:
- Repository name: `vscode-sockpuppet-extension`
- Description: "VS Code extension for programmatic API access from Python"

**Option B: Via GitHub CLI** (if you have `gh` installed)

```powershell
gh auth login

gh repo create jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-python --public `
    --description "Python client for controlling VS Code programmatically"

gh repo create jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-extension --public `
    --description "VS Code extension for programmatic API access from Python"
```

### Step 2: Push Python Repository

After creating the GitHub repo, run these commands:

```powershell
# Create temporary directory for Python repo
cd ..
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path vscode-sockpuppet-python-temp
cd vscode-sockpuppet-python-temp

# Copy Python package files
Copy-Item -Recurse ..\vscode-sockpuppet\python\* .

# Rename standalone README
Move-Item README_STANDALONE.md README.md

# Initialize Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Python package"

# Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-python.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Convert Extension to Use Submodule

```powershell
# Go back to extension directory
cd ..\vscode-sockpuppet

# Remove python folder (it's backed up!)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force python

# Add Python repo as submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-python.git python

# Commit the submodule
git add .gitmodules python
git commit -m "Convert Python package to submodule"
```

### Step 4: Push Extension Repository

```powershell
# Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-extension.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works

Clone in a fresh location to test:

```powershell
# Clone with submodule
cd ..\..
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-extension.git test-clone
cd test-clone

# Verify structure
Get-ChildItem python\  # Should show Python files

# Test extension
npm install
npm run compile

# Test Python package
cd python
pip install -e .
python example.py
```

## Files Created

- âœ… `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - Complete push instructions
- âœ… Backup directory - Full project backup
- âœ… `setup-two-repos-fixed.ps1` - Working setup script

## Important Notes

### Backup Location
Your original files are safely backed up at:
```
..\vscode-sockpuppet-backup-20250930-213045
```

Keep this until you've successfully pushed both repositories!

### Repository Structure After Setup

```
GitHub
â”œâ”€â”€ jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-python (standalone)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vscode_sockpuppet/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LICENSE
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ jnsquire/vscode-sockpuppet-extension
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
    â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
    â”œâ”€â”€ python/ (â†’ submodule)
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Order Matters!

1. **First**: Create and push Python repository
2. **Then**: Convert extension to use submodule
3. **Finally**: Push extension repository

This order ensures the submodule reference works correctly.

## Documentation

- `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - Generated instructions
- `docs/TWO_REPO_SETUP.md` - Complete guide
- `docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` - Structure details
- `GIT_STATUS.md` - Git status reference

## Troubleshooting

**If something goes wrong:**
1. Your backup is safe at `..\vscode-sockpuppet-backup-20250930-213045`
2. You can restore from backup and try again
3. Review `docs/TWO_REPO_SETUP.md` for detailed explanations

**Common issues:**
- Forgot to create GitHub repo first â†’ Create it on GitHub before pushing
- Submodule not showing files â†’ Make sure you used `--recursive` when cloning
- Permission denied â†’ Make sure you're authenticated with GitHub

## Ready to Push!

Your project is fully prepared. Follow the steps above to push to GitHub.

**Summary:**
- âœ… Code committed to Git
- âœ… Backup created
- âœ… Instructions generated
- âœ… Ready to create GitHub repositories
- âœ… Ready to push code

Good luck! ðŸš€
